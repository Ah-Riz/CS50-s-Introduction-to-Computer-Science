CSS Properties Used:
1. background-color - Set on .navbar to define its color (light gray in this case).
2. margin and padding - Adjusted globally (* selector) for a clean default style reset.
3. font-family - Defined globally (body selector) to ensure consistent typography across the site.
4. @media (max-width: 992px) {...} - Media query used to apply styles specific to screens less than 992px wide, such as changing background color of collapsed navbar for better visibility.
5. box-sizing - Set globally (* selector) to ensure padding and border are included in the element's total width and height.

JavaScript: Used primarily for enhancing interactivity, specifically on mobile devices where clicking the navbar toggle button would expand the menu. This was achieved by adding event listeners to detect clicks and trigger the collapse functionality provided by Bootstrap.

Bootstrap: Utilized throughout for responsive design elements such as collapsible navigation bars (`<div class="collapse">`). It also aids in providing a consistent styling framework across different screen sizes, ensuring that on smaller screens (like phones), the navbar collapses into a vertical list to save space and provide an easier user experience.
