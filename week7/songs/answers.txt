If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
- I would characterize from their most played genres.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
- I would make circular graphs of genres and how often they are played.
